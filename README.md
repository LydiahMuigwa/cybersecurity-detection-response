# Cybersecurity Detection & Response

This repository showcases hands-on projects in incident detection, response, and threat analysis. All reports were developed and written as part of SOC analyst and cybersecurity certification training.

Each report highlights real-world simulation scenarios using industry-standard frameworks like **MITRE ATT&CK**, **NIST**, and tools like **VirusTotal**, **Wireshark**, and **EDR** systems.
